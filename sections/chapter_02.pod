=head0 Perl and Its Community

Perl's greatest accomplishment is the huge amount of reusable libraries it has
available.  Larry Wall explicitly encouraged the Perl community to create and
maintain their own extensions to solve every problem imaginable without
fragmenting the language into incompatible pidgins. It worked.

That technical accomplishment was almost as important as the growth of a
community around Perl. I<People> write libraries. I<People> build on the work
of other people. I<People> make a community worth joining and preserving and
expanding.

The Perl community welcomes willing participants at all levels, from novices to
core developers. Take advantage of the knowledge and experience and code of
countless other programmers, and you'll become a better programmer.
