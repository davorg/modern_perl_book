=head0 The Perl Language

The Perl language is a combination of several individual pieces. Although
spoken languages use nuance and tone of voice and intuition to communicate
across gaps in knowledge and understanding, computers and source code require
precision. You can write effective Perl code without knowing every detail of
every language feature, but you must understand how they work together to write
Perl code well.
