Some people call Perl an "operator-oriented language". A Perl I<operator> is a
series of one or more symbols used as part of the syntax of a language. Each
operator operates on zero or more I<operands>. Think of an operator as a
special sort of function the parser understands and its operands as arguments.

You've seen how Perl manages context through its operators. To understand Perl
fully, you must understand how operators interact with their operands.
