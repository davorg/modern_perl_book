=head0 Style and Efficacy

To program well, we must find the balance between getting the job done now and
doing the job right. We must balance time, resources, and quality. Programs
have bugs. Programs need maintenance and expansion. Programs have multiple
programmers. A beautiful program that never delivers value is worthless, but an
awful program that cannot be maintained is a risk waiting to happen.

Skilled programmers understand their constraints and write the right code.

To write Perl well, you must understand the language. You must also cultivate a
sense of good taste for the language and the design of programs. The only way
to do so is to practice--not just writing code, but maintaining and reading
good code.

This path has no shortcuts, but it does have guideposts.
