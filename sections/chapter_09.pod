=head0 Managing Real Programs

Z<writing_real_programs>

You can learn a lot of syntax from a book by writing small programs to solve
the example problems. Writing good code to solve real problems takes more
discipline and understanding. You must learn to I<manage> code. How do you know
that it works? How do you organize it? What makes it robust in the face of
errors? What makes code clean? Clear? Maintainable?

Modern Perl helps you answer all those questions.
